# NGOfinder
#### System Concept Statement
NGOfinder is a Tinder-esque style web application that will allow people with little time and big hearts help support the NGOs that they want to help.  Viewing one profile at a time, the profile will display basic information that will give enough context for the user to decide whether or not they would want to potentially help this organization.  This will allow people who have tight schedules and can’t go out and do research to be able to donate and help NGOs reach a wider demographic.  The user can either immediately donate if it peaks their interest or open up a chat with a representative.  Social media capabilities will allow the user to share if they donated or about the organization after they like it, helping spread the word about the NGO that they discovered.  AI’s will help determine which NGOs you’d most likely donate to after you start liking so the profiles shown to you are tailored to your liking.

### Installation
There is no installation required to use NGOfinder, simply go to people.rit.edu/mrj9235 and start going through all of the NGOs that you find the most interesting!

### Unsupported Features
As of right now, NGOfinder does not support making a personal account.  Simply hit Sign in when prompted with the log in screen and you will be taken to the main page regardless if you put in information or not.

The application also currently does not support messaging NGO representatives as this is just a prototype and no NGOs are currently represented on the application.
